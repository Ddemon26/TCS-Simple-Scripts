## ‚ú® Features

- **DontDestroy**: Ensures that a GameObject is not destroyed when loading a new scene.
- **DestroyOnAwake**: Destroys a GameObject after a specified delay when the script instance is loaded.
- **SimpleRotateObject**: Rotates a GameObject around a specified axis at a specified speed.
- **SimpleRigidBodyPush**: Allows a GameObject with a CharacterController to push Rigidbodies.
- **SimpleCameraController**: A simple camera controller for moving and rotating the camera using keyboard and mouse input.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using the **TCS Simple Scripts**:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/) is installed, as it is required for custom editor features.

4. Open the Unity Editor and access the Simple Scripts through the `Tools` menu.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **DontDestroy**: Attach the `DontDestroy` script to a GameObject to ensure it is not destroyed when loading a new scene.
2. **DestroyOnAwake**: Attach the `DestroyOnAwake` script to a GameObject to destroy it after a specified delay.
3. **SimpleRotateObject**: Attach the `SimpleRotateObject` script to a GameObject to rotate it around a specified axis at a specified speed.
4. **SimpleRigidBodyPush**: Attach the `SimpleRigidBodyPush` script to a GameObject with a CharacterController to allow it to push Rigidbodies.
5. **SimpleCameraController**: Attach the `SimpleCameraController` script to a camera to enable simple movement and rotation using keyboard and mouse input.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

- **DontDestroy**: No customization options.
- **DestroyOnAwake**: Customize the delay before destruction by modifying the `m_delay` field.
- **SimpleRotateObject**: Customize the rotation axis, speed, and direction by modifying the `m_rotationAxis`, `m_rotationSpeed`, and `m_reverse` fields.
- **SimpleRigidBodyPush**: Customize the push layers and strength by modifying the `m_pushLayers` and `m_strength` fields.
- **SimpleCameraController**: Customize the movement keys, boost factor, position lerp time, mouse sensitivity curve, rotation lerp time, cursor lock state, and Y-axis inversion by modifying the respective fields.
