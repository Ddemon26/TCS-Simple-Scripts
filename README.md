## ‚ú® Features

A set of reusable scripts designed to simplify GameObject management, input handling, and scene control in Unity. These scripts are lightweight and versatile, helping to boost productivity.

## Classes Overview

This repository contains the following C# classes:

### Core Components

- **`PrefabSpawner`**  
  Handles spawning prefabs dynamically during runtime.
- **`DestroyOnAwake`**  
  Destroys the GameObject immediately upon initialization.
- **`DontDestroyObject`**  
  Prevents the object from being destroyed during scene transitions.
- **`DontDestroyOnLoad`**  
  Similar to `DontDestroyObject`, but retains across loads.
- **`EnableOrDisableColliderOnAwake`**  
  Toggles a collider component on or off when the scene starts.
- **`SelfDisable`**  
  Disables the object after a specified action or event.
- **`TimedSelfDestruct`**  
  Destroys the GameObject after a set duration.
- **`UnsetParentOnAwake`**  
  Detaches the object from its parent on scene load.

### Camera and Controls

- **`CameraState`**  
  Manages the state of the camera within the scene.
- **`MoveAxis`**  
  Handles movement logic based on axis inputs.
- **`SimpleCameraController`**  
  Implements basic camera movement controls.

### Object Manipulation

- **`AssignAimConstraint`**  
  Assigns an aim constraint to the object.
- **`GameObjectFollowMouse`**  
  Allows a GameObject to follow the mouse pointer on screen.
- **`PositionLerper`**  
  Smoothly interpolates an object's position.
- **`RotationLerper`**  
  Interpolates the rotation of an object.
- **`SimpleRigidBodyPush`**  
  Applies force to a rigidbody for basic physics-based interactions.
- **`SimpleRotateObject`**  
  Rotates an object based on input or predefined logic.
- **`SimpleTranslateObject`**  
  Translates an object over time.
- **`TransformContraint`**  
  Enforces constraints on an object‚Äôs transform.
